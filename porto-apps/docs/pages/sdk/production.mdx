# Deploying to Production

Below are some things to consider before deploying to production.

## 1. Trusted Hosts

To enable the `iframe` Dialog on all browsers in production, ensure your website hostname is added to
the [trusted hosts list](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/porto/blob/main/src/trusted-hosts.ts).

Without this, the `iframe` Dialog will fallback to a popup on browsers that do not support the [IntersectionObserver v2 API](https://web.dev/articles/intersectionobserver-v2).

## 2. Content Security Policy

If you've deployed a Content Security Policy, ensure that you have set Porto up with your CSPs.

The full set of directives that Porto requires are:

- `connect-src` `https://rpc.porto.sh`
- `frame-src` `https://id.porto.sh`
