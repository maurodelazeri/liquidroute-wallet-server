-The exact severity of bugs is determined from a combination of security impact, and the likelihood of this attack occuring, at the discretion of the Ithaca team.

-We currently don‚Äôt have any open bounties for low & info bugs, or gas optimizations. But if you find one, feel free to open an issue in [the account repo](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/account), for good karma.

### Scope

The current bug bounty covers the smart contracts in the [account repo with the version tag at v0.5.4 or above](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/account/releases/tag/v0.5.4). Previous releases and other code are considered out-of-scope.

2. Security vulnerability reports must be sent to [`security@ithaca.xyz`](mailto:security@ithaca.xyz) to be eligible for a bounty.
3. Public disclosure of the bug must be after written approval by the Ithaca team.
