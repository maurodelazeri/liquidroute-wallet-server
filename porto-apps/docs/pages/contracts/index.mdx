## Overview 

The onchain infrastructure that powers Porto consists of the following contracts:

### Porto Account

The Porto Account is a keychain that holds user funds, enforces permissions via [Keys](/contracts/account#keys), manages nonces to prevent replay attacks, and enables secure executions from the account.

### Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is a [privileged](/contracts/account#orchestrator-integration) contract that facilitates trustless interactions between the relay and the account.

### Simulator

The Simulator is a peripheral utility that enables offchain services to obtain accurate gas estimates for intents in a single RPC call.

### Settlement System

The Settlement System enables cross-chain transaction finality through native merkle signature verification. It provides trustless settlement mechanisms for multi-chain intents with interop features including fund transfers, merkle signature verification, and funder interface integration for cross-chain execution.
