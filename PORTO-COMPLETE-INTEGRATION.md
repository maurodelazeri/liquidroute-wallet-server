# Porto Complete Integration

## âœ… What We Have Copied

We have copied **EVERYTHING** from Porto:

### 1. **All Porto Apps** (`porto-apps/`)
- **dialog/** - The main wallet dialog UI (this is what we need for the wallet)
- **id/** - Identity management app
- **playground/** - Testing playground
- **proxy/** - Proxy service
- **service/** - Backend services
- **ui/** - UI component library
- **wagmi/** - Wagmi integration examples
- **~internal/** - Internal shared styles and configs

### 2. **Porto Core SDK** (`porto-src/`)
- All the core Porto functionality
- Messenger system
- Dialog system
- Trusted hosts
- Remote actions
- CLI tools
- Viem integration

### 3. **Porto Examples** (`porto-examples/`)
- All example implementations
- Theming examples
- Integration patterns

### 4. **Porto Configuration**
- `porto-package.json` - Complete dependency list
- `porto-tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

## What Needs To Be Done

Porto is a **pnpm monorepo** with complex build processes. To integrate it into our Next.js app:

### Option 1: Full Monorepo Setup (Most Complete)
1. Convert our project to use pnpm
2. Set up the monorepo structure
3. Install all Porto dependencies
4. Run Porto's build scripts
5. Integrate the built dialog app

### Option 2: Direct Integration (What we're attempting)
1. Extract the dialog app components
2. Adapt them to work with Next.js
3. Replace Ethereum-specific parts with Solana
4. Keep Porto's exact UI/UX

### Option 3: Build Porto Separately (Clean separation)
1. Set up Porto in a separate directory
2. Build the dialog app
3. Serve it as a static HTML file
4. Embed via iframe in our Next.js app

## Current Status

We have **ALL** the Porto source code. Every single file. The complete implementation is here:
- The dialog UI that creates the beautiful interface
- The ID management system
- The proxy and service layers
- All the UI components
- The complete SDK

The challenge is not getting the code (we have it all), but integrating Porto's complex build system with our Next.js setup.

## For Solana Integration

To make this work with Solana instead of Ethereum:
1. Keep all of Porto's UI/UX (it's chain-agnostic)
2. Replace the Ethereum signing logic with our Solana passkey wallet
3. Use Porto's message passing system as-is
4. Adapt the RPC methods to Solana's needs

Everything is here. We just need to decide on the integration approach.
